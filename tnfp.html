        Swamy Nagar, Bellary By-pass road, Anantapur on the date of 07 th November, 2017.</p>

        <div class="highlight">AIM</div>

        price for their produce. There by enhancing the economic status and health of the locally
        farmers, and give the healthy millet food products to the customers.</p>

        <div class="highlight">OBJECTIVE</div>
        <ul class="objective-list">
            <li>To improve the income of the farmers and farmer-based workers to improvise the
            socio-economic conditions.</li>
            <li>To create scope of self-employment by engaging un-employed youth/ local Wenders
            in the marketing the value-added produce.</li>
            <li>To Create marketing linkages value added produce.</li>

            patients.</li>
            <li>To supply the high-quality millet value added products to super markets, Malls,
            Agencies and local Wenders.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">IMPORTANCE OF THE VALUE ADDITION</div>
        <p>Anantapur district is one of the most drought-prone areas, and about 70% of agriculture
            come under dryland farming. The farmers have to depend on seasonal rains for the single
            crop they cultivate in their dry lands.
            However, the agricultural inputs they have to invest are the same – i.e., they have to invest
            on various farm works (activities like land ploughing, levelling, sowing, weeding, harvesting
            etc.), and spraying of fertilizers and pesticides. The risk in this farm of agriculture is the
            failure of crops due to failure of rains (in-time monsoonal failures). This results in heavy
            losses to the farmers. The major crops produced in the district are groundnut, paddy, millets
            and different greens and vegetables.
            However, in the case of a good monsoon season also the farmers are seen entering into
            losses due to steep downfall of market prices. As a result, the farmers are pushed to go for
            distress sale thereby incurring heavy losses. The farmers, in this area, sell the produce as a
            raw material – a process in which they are cheated on prices as well as on weights – both
            acts incurring loss to the farmers.
            
            Under these conditions, there is a need to see that the farmers are given a chance to either
            preserve the agricultural produce, or push it into the market by way of converting them into
            some other form which can increase its value, attract end-user and the marketers. This
            requires them to get involved in understanding the process, get involved, and use skills to
            reap benefits out of this.</p>

        <div class="highlight">SITUATION ANALYSIS/ PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>
        <p>Millets are considered as miracle grains as they are the store houses of the nutrients
        required for healthy living. Malnutrition among vulnerable groups such as adolescent girls,
        pregnant and lactating women and children is an enduring problem in rural areas. Millets
        offer protentional solution for combating malnutrition as they are rich in carbohydrates,
        protein, minerals and phyto chemicals. Though they are the oldest grains since ages people
        have been consuming, their consumption have been gradually decreased due to difficulty of
        its processing and surplus availability of rice and wheat after green revolution. But
        processing and value addition of millets have lot of scope in promoting balanced diet and
        entrepreneurship.</p>
